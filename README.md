# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to build a table using UFO sightings data stored in a JavaScript array, as well as creating filters to make the table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. From there the customization of the webpage using Bootstrap, equiping the table with several fully functional filters, allows users to interact with the visualizations.

### Resources
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS

## Results
There is a description of how to perform a search, with images

## Summary

### One Drawback of this Webpage
- The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

### Two additional recommendations for further development
- Adding functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data globally.
- Adding another filter button below the filter search will serve as the enter button for all five filter searches.
