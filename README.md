# UFOs

## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to build a table using UFO sightings data stored in a JavaScript array, as well as creating filters to make the table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. From there the customization of the webpage using Bootstrap, equiping the table with several fully functional filters, allows users to interact with the visualizations.

### Resources
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS

## Results
![website_title](https://github.com/pfrivas/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/Website%20Title.png)
The UFO sighting webpage includes five different filter search boxes on the left side of the page, which includes the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Filtering on the webpage can be either done by entering the filter formation into the filter search box. The results of the information entered into the filter search box will return the UFOs sightings for the exact information entered in the filter search.

## Summary

### Drawbacks of this Webpage
- The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

### Additional recommendations for further development
- Adding functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data globally.
- Adding additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.
